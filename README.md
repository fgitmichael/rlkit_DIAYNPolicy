# Diversity Is All You Need (DIAYN) Implementation using RLkit

Implementation of Proximal Diversity Is All You Need (DIAYN) using the reinforcement learning framework [RLKit](https://github.com/vitchyr/rlkit) by [vitchyr](https://github.com/vitchyr).
Installation for RLKit is specified in the [original README for RLKit](README_RLKIT.md).

### Running the Example Script for DIAYN
First, run the following command for training the sub-policies:
```
python examples/diayn.py <NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT>
```

In addition, you can specify the number of skills that DIAYN is going to learn. The default is set at 10.
```
python examples/diayn.py <NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT> --skill_dim <NUMBER_OF_SKILLS>
```

After training DIAYN, a file is saved onto `data/DIAYN_'DIAYN_<NUMBER_OF_SKILLS>_<ENVIRONMENT>_<DATE_AND_TIME>`. Use the saved file to train the manager using PPO.
```
python examples/ppo_diayn.py <NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT> <PATH_TO_SUB_POLICY>/params.pkl
```

Run the following command for visualizing the trained policies:
```
python scripts/run_policy_diayn.py <PATH_TO_SUB_POLICY>/params.pkl
```

### Running the Example Script for PPO
Run the following command:
```
python examples/ppo.py
```
Here is an example implementation result on the OpenAI Gym environment, Bipedal Walker-v2:
